Anything that does not work
Seems all work

Anything else you think might help the grader grade your project more easily
I split each part into several files(basically: view, model, controller). 
Based on the instructions, I made some improvements:
1. I made enemies turn around when colliding with player because it's more realistic in my opinion.
2. I made player go back to starting position when colliding with enemies.
